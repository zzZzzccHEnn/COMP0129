Description: This package forms the base ROS workspace for the coursework of module COMP0129 (https://github.com/COMP0129-UCL/comp0129_s23_robot.git): Robotic Sensing, Manipulation and Interaction.

## Pre-Requisites
```bash
> sudo apt install ros-noetic-franka-ros ros-noetic-libfranka
```
Gazebo physics simluator is also needed (http://gazebosim.org/). This can be installed and then run with:
```bash
> curl -sSL http://get.gazebosim.org | sh
> gazebo
```

## Installation
1. Download this folder into your **your_catkin_workspace/src/** (replace **your_catkin_workspace** to the name of your folder).

2. Build this project through command:  

```bash
> cd your_catkin_workspace
> catkin build
```

## Run Panda robot Gazebo and rviz
```bash
> source devel/setup.bash
> roslaunch cw1_team_4 run_solution.launch
```

## Visualizing Task 1, 2 & 3
* This cousework contains three tasks including grasping, color detection and a planning task contains these two. For visualizing each task, run following command after run the Panda robot Gazebo and rviz:

```bash
> rosservice call /task x
```
**x** is the index of task, which is **1, 2 or 3**. Replace **x** with your choice.

* A Point Cloud viewer has been implemented and will pop up when do `rosservice call /task x`. It provide the robot's perspectives. If nothing can be seen from the window, try scroll using mouse.    

## Algorithms description

* Task 1: Pick and Place at given positions.

  Step 1: add collision objects to the Moveit motion planning.  

  Step 2: move to the approach pose just above the cube and open the gripper.

  Step 3: move to the grasp pose which is the centroid of cubes (given).

  Step 4: move to the release_pose which is at some distance above the basket (given).

  Step 5: open the grippers and drop cube on the basket. 

* Task 2: Basket Colour identification.

  Step 1: move to the first given position (given)

  Step 2: use the subscribed point cloud to classify the colour (Voxel Grid and Pass through filtered, plane segmented).

  Step 3: repeat Step  2 until all given position has been checked.

* Task 3: Planning and Execution. 

  Step 1: move to a scan pose to get the overview of all objects on the working desk.

  Step 2: using a Euclidean Cluster to find cubes and baskets. 

  Step 3: based on point cloud of each sub-clusters, return colour, category (basket/cube) and position.

  Step 4: move to one cube, similar as task 1 to place it on basket in corresponding colour.

## Potential Error

* This may pop up on command in some cases. To solve it, we have to re-`roslaunch` the project.

```bash
[cw1_solution_node-19] process has died [pid 90014, exit code -6, cmd /home/wancai/comp0129_s23_robot/devel/lib/cw1_team_4/cw1_solution_node __name:=cw1_solution_node __log:=/home/wancai/.ros/log/59bb9b7a-b913-11ed-963c-db5ae5b7568a/cw1_solution_node-19.log].
log file: /home/wancai/.ros/log/59bb9b7a-b913-11ed-963c-db5ae5b7568a/cw1_solution_node-19*.log
```

* Also, task 3 has some situations where noise is regarded as cube. Those noise may present a position that robot can not reach and thus lead to the failure of motion planning. In this case, we can only re-`rosservice call /task 3` to start a new task. However, after optimising the hyperparameter of PCL segmentation algorithms, this problems has been less likely to happen (approximately 1 out of 20 tests). 

  *<u>(Task 3 is challenging and we found that our method may be not robust enough to solve all situations. So please, test it serval times to see its general performance.)</u>*

* Euclidean Clustering is not stable as the hyperparameters have not been turned/optimised using any optimisation algorithm. Consequently, in some cases, the returned centroid position of cube may have error, which lead to a unreliable motion planning and crash happened. 

## Performance/Accuracy

From our experiments which run three tasks repeatedly (20 times), the accuracy of each algorithms:

* Task 1: 100%
* Task 2: 95%
* Task 3: 90%
